  ## Aviation

  ✈️ I’m currently training to obtain my Private Pilot License (PPL) and love exploring the world of aviation. Whether it’s learning how planes work, exploring the history of aviation, or immersing myself in flight simulation, I’m always looking for new ways to learn and grow.

  See more in my [aviation notes](https://docs.tinkernerd.dev/aviation).

  ## Other Things

  When I’m not coding or doing who knows what, I like try to keep active and explore the outdoors. 
	<br/> I’ve recently started integrating fitness tracking and outdoor adventures into my routine. Here’s a live look at my Strava activity:
